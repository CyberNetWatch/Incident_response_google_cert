Additional Notes

How can the company prevent future similar attacks?

- Implement email filtering and attachment scanning solutions.
- Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
- Apply regular software updates and patches.
- Maintain and test offline backups frequently.
- Segment networks to minimize damage in case of compromise.

Are there any backups?
This must be verified. The company should assess the availability and integrity of recent backups.

Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key?
It is generally discouraged to pay the ransom, as it incentivizes further attacks and does not guarantee data recovery. Instead, the incident should be reported to law enforcement and cybersecurity professionals should be consulted.
